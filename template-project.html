      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>Growing up we found learning mathematics was very boring, and felt like a chore, and the problem behind learning is that there is nothing fun to stimulate the children and to get them excited about it. As a result, children may develop
        a dependency on the internet, rather than actually learning/figuring out the material themselves. Our goal is to create a fun environment for children to learn mathematics, to get them excited about learning, and to learn to count on
        themselves.</p>

      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <div class="flex-container" id="descriptionSection">
        <div class="block1">
          <p>This project is an interactive toy aimed at helping children learn basic mathematics, by inserting numbers into its respective slots. The toy uses force sensors to detect when a number has been inserted into the slot, a proximity sensor
            to turn on/off the toy when someone is within 40cm, and touch sensors to allow users to select the level of difficulty.</p>
